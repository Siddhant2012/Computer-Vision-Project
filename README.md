# Computer-Vision-Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of keypoint detection and matching algorithms using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. It focuses on identifying significant features in images and matching them across different views or transformations.

Implemented Algorithms:-

SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
Detects and matches keypoints between images, robust to scale and rotation changes.

RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)
Filters out outlier matches and fits a homography model using inlier keypoints.

Harris Corner Detection
Identifies corner-like features in a grayscale image based on intensity gradients.
